Redux
-------
# Setting up Redux
    * Installing Required Packages 
              yarn add redux redux-logger react-redux  
    * Add Redux Related code need to be in separate folder under src 
    * root.reducer.js is the root reducer 
    * user.readucer.js is the reducer of the user which holds the following method

        const userReducer = (state = INITIAL_STATE, action) => {                  // State is current state, 
            switch(action.type){                                                  //Action holds type (type of the action ) and payload (data to be modified) 
                case 'SET_CURRENT_USER':
                                         return{
                                                  ...state,
                                                  currentUser : action.payload
                                                }
                 default : return state;
             }
        }

        user.action.js --> holds the function to modify user action object 

    * Root Reducer have combineReducers that holds all the reducer 
    * Creating Store 
        --> Create a separate file called store.js 
        --> We have import createStore, applyMiddleware function from redux, logger from redux-logger and rootReducer
        --> we have to convert logger to array and pass it to applyMiddleware function & result to  createStore function along with rootReducer  

            import {createStore, applyMiddleware  } from "redux";
            import logger from 'redux-logger';
            import rootReducer from "./root-reducer";
                const middlewares = [logger];
                const store = createStore(rootReducer, applyMiddleware(...middlewares));
                export default store;

    * At Index.js we have wrap <App> Componenet with <Proiver> pass store to it
